# BS-2DBPPGC

A Beam Search implementation for the two-dimmensional Bin Packing Problem with Guillotine Cuts (2D-BPPGC). It supports homogeneous and heterogeneous bins, using the implementations from [BS-2DBPPGC-homogeneous-bins](https://github.com/calegria/BS-2DBPPGC-homogeneous-bins) and [BS-2DBPPGC-heterogeneous-bins](https://github.com/calegria/BS-2DBPPGC-heterogeneous-bins).
